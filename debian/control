Description: Python bindings for the Linux input subsystem
 This package provides bindings to the generic input event interface
 in Linux. The evdev interface serves the purpose of passing events
 generated in the kernel directly to userspace through character
 devices that are typically located in /dev/input/.
 .
 This package also comes with bindings to uinput, the userspace input
 subsystem. Uinput allows userspace programs to create and handle
 input devices that can inject events directly into the input
 subsystem.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
