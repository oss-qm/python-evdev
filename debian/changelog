  * Limit the architecture to linux-any. Closes: #875624.
  * Switch to Python 3 Docutils and Sphinx, build-conflicting on
    python-sphinx to avoid issues with that being picked in preference to
    python3-sphinx.
  * Clean up debian/control with cme.
  * Drop the new-package-should-not-package-python2-module override
    since this is no longer a new package.
  * Standards-Version 4.1.1, no change required.
